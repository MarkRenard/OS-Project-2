usage: ./oss [-h] [-n x -s x -b B -i I -o filename]
 -h           Prints this help message
 -n x         Maximum total number of child processes (default 4)
 -s x         Maximum number of simultaneous children (default 2, max 20)
 -b B         Start of the sequence to be tested for primality (default 5)
 -i I         Increment between numbers to be tested (default 2)
 -o filename  Specifies the name of the output file (default output.log)

This program will launch a series of child processes that each determine
whether a particular integer is prime where the least integer is entered
using -b, the increment between them is selected with -i, and the number of
integers tested is entered using -n. It will print the results to the
file specified by -o, including simulated execution and termination times
of the child processes.

Functions for parsing options are defined in ossOptions.c.

sharedMemory.c makes creating a single shared memory region for several
processes that share the key stored in shmkey.h more convenient.

perrorExit.c contains a utility that makes it easier to output
"./oss: Error: ..." formatted error messages using perror. It stores the
executable name in a global that can be set with

	exeName = argv[0]

at the beginning of main.

I'm turning this in before 11 AM on 2/27/2020. I wasn't certain the extension
applied to the whole class, so if it doesn't, you can look at the prior commit.
